# This is not ProjectE!
It may look like ProjectE, but it is actually NotProjectE, not ProjectE. As this is an MIT licensed project, you can do what you want to the source and I, or anyone else, can't revoke consent. Even if you're profiteering, or I think you're evil!

# Credits
All credits of work conducted currently go to the authors of the original project (https://github.com/sinkillerj/ProjectE) but this may change if this mod gets maintained.
